# File Encryption/Decryption

This application allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using a simple XOR cipher algorithm. It provides an easy way to protect your sensitive files by converting them into an encrypted format and then decrypting them back to their original state when needed.

## Features

- Encrypt files using a XOR cipher algorithm
- Decrypt files using the same XOR cipher algorithm
- Simple and straightforward user interface
- Support for binary file encryption and decryption

## Usage

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code.
4. Compile the source code using the following command:
   ```
   g++ -o app cryptoapp.cpp
   ```
5. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./app
   ```
6.Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt your files.
7.The encrypted or decrypted file will be created in the same directory as the input file with the appropriate extension.

## Example

Suppose you have a file named input.txt that you want to encrypt and decrypt using the key secretkey. After running the application, you can specify the input file, encryption output file, and decryption output file within the code or as command-line arguments. For example:
```
   std::string inputFile = "input.txt";
   std::string encryptedFile = "encrypted.bin";
   std::string decryptedFile = "decrypted.txt";
   std::string key = "secretkey";

   encryptFile(inputFile, encryptedFile, key);
   decryptFile(encryptedFile, decryptedFile, key);
```
## Security Note

Please note that the XOR cipher used in this application is a simple encryption technique and may not provide strong security against sophisticated attacks. It is used here for demonstration purposes only. For secure encryption and decryption, it is recommended to use established cryptographic libraries or algorithms like AES, RSA, or DES.
